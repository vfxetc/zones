- Strip trailing '.@'.
    - Assert that names follow the specs after that.

- '@' turns into None.

- Don't allow absolute names that don't match the origin.

- Zone.subzone(name) -> Subzone
    Subzone proxies all methods to the zone, but by joining the name on first.

- Zone.dmarc(name, rua=..., ruf=..., **kwargs)
- Zone.dkim(name, p, k='rsa', v='DKIM1')
- These return odict-y TXT records that return '; '.join('{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in self.items())

- SPF returns list-y TEXT record that return ' '.join(self)

- Use `named-checkconf -p` to assert it is looking at the right file.
